Project Cycle 3: Ebird sightings and photos

<b>Description / Purpose:</b>
  Ebird lacks the feature to see all your species without your photos, meaning there is no "Target Species" list available. This makes it difficult to manage if you should be uploading a mediocre photo in the name of filling out your seen list.


<b>Dependencies:</b>
  Connected to online hosting for PHPMyAdmin. Hosted locally on XAMPP and written in PHPStorm in PHP 8.1, debugged with
  XDEBUG helper. Bootstrap 5.3.0 used and JS. Vanta.Birds used for header.

<b>Usage:</b>
  This Ebird App is setup on the backend for the user, your data will need to be pulled from Ebird as a CSV and modified for MySQL. You will need 2 lists: All birds seen and a photo catalog export. Download or copy a new repository to add your own CSV data.
  

<b>Future Work:</b>
  Possible updated include adding I frames to locally see photo links, additionally a map for local sightings of needed bird photos. Last sighting may also be hepful for searching photo files.

<b>My major:</b>
  I am studying information science and graphic design. So far, this project has included the usage of dynamically
  created objects and classes in PHP and HTML. The background includes CSS and JS work for an interactive piece.
  Security and injection were considered for all endpoints.
